# CLAUDE.md — Coding Context for Lattice

This file provides context for Claude (or any LLM) working on the Lattice codebase.
Read this first, then consult docs/architecture/ and docs/decisions/ for details.

## What is Lattice?

A distributed workload scheduler that sits between Slurm (HPC batch) and Kubernetes (cloud services). It schedules both finite jobs (training runs, simulations) and infinite jobs (inference services, monitoring) on a shared HPC infrastructure with:
- Slingshot/Ultra Ethernet interconnect
- GPU-accelerated nodes (NVIDIA GH200, AMD MI300X, etc.)
- VAST-like tiered storage (NFS + S3)
- OpenCHAMI infrastructure management (Redfish BMC)
- uenv software delivery (SquashFS mount namespaces)
- Sensitive/regulated workload isolation requirements

## Architecture Summary

### Control Plane
- **Raft Quorum** (3-5 replicas): Strong consistency for node ownership + sensitive audit
- **vCluster Schedulers**: Per-workload-type schedulers (HPC backfill, service bin-pack, sensitive reservation, interactive FIFO)
- Each vCluster scheduler proposes allocations → quorum validates and commits

### Scheduling Algorithm
Multi-dimensional knapsack with composite cost function:
```
Score(j) = Σ wᵢ · fᵢ(j)
  f₁ = priority_class         (preemption tier)
  f₂ = wait_time_factor       (anti-starvation, ages with queue time)
  f₃ = fair_share_deficit      (tenant equity)
  f₄ = topology_fitness        (Slingshot dragonfly group packing)
  f₅ = data_readiness          (is input data on hot tier?)
  f₆ = backlog_pressure        (queue depth)
  f₇ = energy_cost             (time-varying electricity price)
  f₈ = checkpoint_efficiency   (preemption cost)
  f₉ = conformance_fitness     (node config homogeneity)
```
Weights are tunable per vCluster. Use RM-Replay simulator to test weight changes before production.

### Consistency Model
- **Strong (Raft-committed)**: (1) Node ownership (2) Sensitive audit state (3) Service registry (4) Sessions
- **Eventually consistent**: Job queues, telemetry, quota accounting

### Key Abstractions
- **Allocation**: The universal work unit (replaces Slurm job + K8s pod)
  - lifecycle: bounded (batch) | unbounded (service) | reactive (autoscale)
  - Has resources, constraints, dependencies, network domain, uenv
  - Unbounded/Reactive allocations support liveness probes (TCP/HTTP) and service endpoint registration
- **vCluster**: A view/projection of resources with its own scheduler policy
- **Task Group**: Equivalent of Slurm job arrays
- **DAG**: Directed acyclic graph of allocations with dependency edges (Slurm-compatible: afterok, afternotok, afterany, aftercorr)
- **Network Domain**: Allocations sharing a domain get L3 reachability (Slingshot VNI)
- **Tenant**: Organizational boundary (quotas, isolation, audit)
- **Service Registry**: Auto-populated when allocations with `expose` endpoints reach Running; queried via LookupService/ListServices RPCs
- **Session**: Interactive attach session tracked globally in Raft state; sensitive allocations limited to one concurrent session (INV-C2)
- **Liveness Probe**: TCP or HTTP health check on service allocations; failures trigger requeue via reconciliation loop

### Two-Tier API
1. **Intent API** (agent-native): Agents declare what they need, scheduler resolves how
2. **Compatibility API** (Slurm-like): sbatch/squeue/scancel mapped to Intent API

### Software Delivery
- **Default: uenv** — SquashFS images mounted via mount namespace (near-zero overhead)
- **When needed: Sarus** — OCI containers for isolation, third-party images
- **Registry**: JFrog/Nexus → S3 backing, optional node-local NVMe cache

### Storage Integration
- Hot tier: VAST (NFS + S3), scheduler can set QoS, pre-stage data, snapshot
- Warm/Cold: tiered, S3-compatible
- Sensitive: encrypted pool, access-logged, wipe-on-release
- Data mover: pre-stages during queue wait time (invisible to user)

### Telemetry
- Collection: eBPF (always-on, <0.3% overhead)
- Aggregation: switchable resolution (prod: 30s bicubic, debug: 1s raw, audit: access logs)
- Storage: time-series store, three views (holistic, tenant, vCluster)
- Feeds back into cost function (GPU util, network congestion, I/O patterns)

### Checkpointing
Scheduler-coordinated with cost function:
- checkpoint when Value(recompute_saved + preemptability + backlog_relief) > Cost(write_time + compute_waste + storage_cost)
- Backlog pressure increases checkpoint aggressiveness
- Applications implement checkpoint API (signal, shmem flag, or gRPC callback)
- Fallback: DMTCP transparent checkpointing or non-preemptible flag

### Service Lifecycle
- **Reconciliation loop**: Scheduler detects failed Unbounded/Reactive allocations, requeues per requeue policy (OnNodeFailure/Always) up to max_requeue (capped at 100)
- **Liveness probes**: TCP or HTTP health checks configured per service allocation; ProbeManager in node agent runs periodic checks; failure threshold triggers allocation failure → reconciler requeues
- **Service discovery**: Endpoints auto-registered in GlobalState when allocation reaches Running; deregistered on terminal state or requeue. Query via LookupService/ListServices gRPC + REST `/api/v1/services`
- **Bin-pack density**: ServiceBinPackScheduler packs services into fewest dragonfly groups (density-first sorting)
- **Scale executor**: ScaleExecutor trait translates autoscaler decisions into infrastructure actions (boot/drain nodes via OpenCHAMI)

### Audit Integrity
- Ed25519 signed entries with SHA-256 hash chain
- Signing key loaded from persistent file (`audit_signing_key_path` in QuorumConfig); random key in dev mode
- Tamper detection: signature verification + chain integrity check
- Archive compaction preserves chain continuity across S3 chunks

### Federation (Optional — pluggable via feature flag)
- Sovra for cryptographic trust (federated sovereign key management)
- Loose coupling: federation broker suggests, local scheduler decides
- Data gravity drives placement
- Sensitive data sovereignty enforced (data stays at designated site)
- System fully functional without federation

### Sensitive Workload Model
- User (not cluster) claims nodes → quorum records user identity as owner
- Dedicated nodes, no sharing, hardened OS image via OpenCHAMI
- Encrypted storage pool, all access logged, wipe on release
- Signed uenv images only, vulnerability-scanned
- 7-year audit retention
- Risk-averse: no clever optimizations on sensitive resources

## Key External Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| OpenCHAMI | Infrastructure management | Go, separate deployment, API integration |
| Sovra | Federation trust | Go, optional, pluggable |
| FirecREST | Optional compatibility gateway | Passthrough for hybrid Slurm deployments, not required |
| uenv/squashfs-mount | Software delivery | C, existing binary, integrated by node agent |
| Sarus | OCI container runtime | C++, existing, used by node agent |
| libfabric | Network abstraction | C, Slingshot/UE interface |
| VAST API | Storage integration | REST API calls from scheduler |
| Waldur | External accounting & billing | REST API, optional, pluggable |

## What NOT to Do

- Don't add Kubernetes dependencies — this is not a K8s extension
- Don't implement a full container orchestrator — Sarus/uenv handle execution
- Don't build a storage system — integrate with VAST/Lustre via their APIs
- Don't reimplement Raft from scratch — use a proven library (openraft)
- Don't make federation mandatory — it's always feature-gated
- Don't optimize for microservice scale — this schedules tens-to-hundreds of large allocations, not millions of pods
